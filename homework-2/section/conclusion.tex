\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In summary, the IR systems developed in this study followed the Parsing-Analyzer-Index-Search-Topic paradigm and utilized different methodologies, among which the following stand out: processing of English documents based on whitespace tokenization, the TERRIER stopword list, query expansion, and stemming; processing of French documents based on whitespace tokenization, a stopword list and stemming; character N-grams of both versions concatenated; and NER information extraction using NLP techniques.\\

In terms of future work, there are several areas that could be explored to improve the effectiveness of the developed IR systems. Firstly, we could improve indexing methodologies, such as increasing the value of \textit{N} in N-gram, as we have commented on in Section~\ref{sec:results}. Secondly, we could explore better NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of the IR systems, as NER turns out not to be very effective.\\

Overall results suggests we did not achieve the best possible results, since we preferred to explore multiple simple approaches rather than a single complex one. In most cases ANOVA results shows that we don't have a significant difference between the systems, so that we could start from any of them and improve.\\

One last possible future work could be a machine-learning based IR system. This would be a more dynamic approach to IR systems, as it would be able to adapt to different types of queries and documents.
